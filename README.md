# Category level
You can set 6 category levels in Github.

If you want set a Category title,
you just write # char that front of title.

If you want down the category level,
you write more # char.


# Function of '`' Character
If you want set a high-light in source code,
you just write your programming-language name besides '```'.

For example,
```java
public class FirstJava{
  public firstJava(){
  //comments
  }
}
```
